1. **What is cybersecurity, and why is it important?**
Cybersecurity refers to the protection of computer systems, networks, and information from malicious attack (hackers) and viruses. It is important because it prevents the theft of sensitive personal information such as passwords or financial information like banking details.

2. **Define the terms Virus, Malware, and Ransomware.**
Virus: This is a malicious program that transfers from one user’s computer to another one and corrupts the files or the system.
Malware: All types of viruses are classified as bad software and devices or data are always harmed
Ransomware: A category of malware that locks files, then demands payment to restore access.

3. **Explain the difference between a Threat, Vulnerability, and Risk in cybersecurity.**
Threat: Considered a potential danger for example hackers.
Vulnerability: A concern of the system, such as use of weak passwords.
Risk: The odds of an exploitative agent penetrating the security and causing damage.

4. **What is Phishing? Provide an example.**
Phishing is defined as the act of deception to obtain sensitive personal information, such as passwords, and utilizes the identity of a trusted party. Example: You receive an email that seems to have originated from your bank which seeks your password.

5. **How do firewalls protect network security?**
Firewalls serve as the guards of a computer network. They examine all information attempting to go in and out, and if any information appears to be questionable they will blacklist it so that the intruders are kept away.

6. **What is a VPN and why is it used?**
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure tunnel for your internet connection. It hides your online activity, like visiting a website, so hackers or trackers can’t see what you’re doing.

7. **Explain the concept of a secure Password.**
A secure password is hard to guess. It should be long, include numbers, symbols, and both uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, “MyD0g!sAwesome2023” is better than “password123.”

8. **What are the common techniques for securing a computer network?**
Use strong passwords.
Install and update antivirus software.
Use firewalls to block threats.
Keep software updated.
Teach users to avoid suspicious emails or links.

9. **What is two-factor authentication, and why is it important?**
Two-step verification requires an additional action before a user is able to access the account, for instance the user is issued a code through their mobile device after entering their passwords. It is quite essential as even if a malicious individual gets a hold of your password, they will be unable to proceed forth without this additional step.

10. **Define the terms Encryption and Decryption.**
Encryption: It is the process of encoding data so as to ensure its security.
Decryption: It is decoding of data that was hidden under a certain code which makes it unavailable to some. For instance, a lock on a diary could be regarded as encryption, whereas the key representing the lock's code serves as the reader.
